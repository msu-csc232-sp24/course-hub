## Instructor Contact Information

Instructor: Jim Daehn<br />
Email: [jdaehn@missouristate.edu](mailto:jdaehn@missouristate.edu)<br />
Office Hours: By appointment only (generally via a Teams meeting)<br />
Office Location: 201B Cheek Hall<br />

### Communication Expectations

Emails received during the week (Monday–Friday), will be responded to within
24 hours. Emails received over the weekend or during breaks/holidays will
receive a response within 48 hours (about 2 days).
Since I work full time outside the university, I may not always answer the
phone (or immediately respond to text messages). However, I'll respond to any
text messages or voice mail as soon as possible.

For class-related questions, please utilize the appropriate channel in Microsoft
Teams. For example, questions related to course material should be asked in the
"lectures" channel; questions related to labs should be asked in the "labs"
channel, etc. I will check the Microsoft Teams channels daily and will answer
questions as needed. I also highly encourage students to read and respond to
postings from their classmates. Part of the nature of this class is for students
to help each other troubleshoot problems and develop critical-thinking skills
and working through questions on the forum is an excellent method to develop
proficiency in these areas.

## Student Success

At Missouri State University we are committed to student success. A key element
to your success as a student is to engage in all course activities and to
communicate with your instructor. If you anticipate or experience academic
barriers during the course, contact your instructor right away, so you can
discuss options.

## Learning Outcomes

Assessment is a process used by instructors to help improve learning. Assessment
is essential for effective learning because it provides feedback to both
students and instructors. A critical step in this process is making clear the
course's student learning outcomes that describe what students are expected to
learn to be successful in the course. The student learning outcomes for this
course are listed below. By collecting data and sharing it with students on how
well they are accomplishing these learning outcomes students can more
efficiently and effectively focus their learning efforts.

This information can also help instructors identify challenging areas for
students and adjust their teaching approach to facilitate learning.

Upon completion of this course, students will:

* Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of object-oriented design and
  programming.
* Know the concepts of several techniques of data organization (lists, stacks,
  queues, trees, etc.).
* Recognize those types of data organization within human problem solving.
* Define a solution to a problem, where the solution is expressed in terms of
  algorithms, data structures, classes, functions, methods, etc.
* Use C++ language to implement several techniques of data organization.
* Use language documentation to determine the existence and use of
  language-provided code, such as data structures and classes.
* Describe and apply basic algorithm analysis.
* Be familiar with fundamental principles of software engineering.

## Required Course Materials

**Textbook**: **_Data Abstraction & Problem-Solving with C++ Walls And Mirrors_
**, Seventh
Edition, by Frank M. Carrano and Timothy M. Henry, ISBN 13: 978-0-13-446397-1
©2017 Pearson Education, Inc. This textbook will be accessible via VitalSource
with Blackboard.

## Technology

The use of technology is a part of our everyday lives at the university and
there is essential information you should know about your own computer’s
capabilities, Internet access, Slack, and other technology tools whether you are
participating in a classroom on campus or taking an online class. For
information on the basic computer requirements to be successful in class visit
the [Knowledge Base for Computer Requirements](https://missouristate.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1931/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=107376)
on the Missouri State University
website.

It is strongly recommended that, in addition to your standard means of access,
you have an alternative plan for acquiring course materials, should your
computer fail to function, or your Internet connectivity becomes disrupted. The
MSU campus library is an excellent option if it is nearby; otherwise, most
public libraries offer Internet access. If you have a laptop computer, then
familiarity with local “hotspots” might also serve you well. It is your
responsibility to address technical problems actively and proactively,
therefore, develop a plan to address technical problems before they arise. If
you need assistance the MSU helpdesk may be able to help. The MSU helpdesk can
be reached by phone at 417-836-5891 or by
emailing [HelpDesk@MissouriState.edu](mailto:HelpDesk@MissouriState.edu).
You can also visit the Help Desk website for a live chat option.

improve accessibility at MSU.

## Course Assignment Descriptions

Your final grade is calculated using the following components:

* **Lab** - Weekly lab assignments are scheduled

| Component  | Weight (%) |
|------------|-----------:|
| Lab        |         50 |
| Homework   |         25 |
| Quiz       |         15 |
| Final Exam |         10 |

Our final exam is given on **Wednesday, May 8, 2024, from 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM**.

## Course Specific Policies

Attendance will be taken daily. I am required to report non-attendance to the
university; this is related to financial aid.

**Note**: Attendance does not factor directly into your final grade.

In addition to attending classes, I expect my students to participate often,
both in the classroom and online. Please note that simply logging into the
course site does not count as participation. As mentioned above, participation
does not contribute towards your final grade. However, experience has shown that
students that actively engage in their online courses tend to perform better
than those that do not.

**Course Schedule**: Our class "week" will begin on Monday and end at midnight (
central standard time) on Sunday. Laboratory assignments must be submitted (via
Microsoft Teams) by the end of the lab period. Review the Course Schedule for an
overview of the schedule and the due dates for each week. New assignments (if
applicable) and discussion board questions will become available as scheduled on
Teams. The course Schedule is in the Class Materials folder under the Files tab
in the General channel on Teams.

**Netiquette/Civility**: Faculty at MSU are committed to developing and actively
protecting a class environment in which respect must be shown to everyone to
facilitate and encourage the expression, testing, understanding, and creation of
a variety of ideas and opinions. You may find
the [Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html)
helpful for information on proper conduct when interacting with others online.

Rude, sarcastic, obscene, or disrespectful posts have a negative impact on
everyone's learning and will not be tolerated. As the instructor, I reserve the
right to remove any discussion I deem to be disrespectful or offensive. Any
person engaging in disrespectful or disruptive behavior will be subject to the
university's misconduct policy outlined in
the [Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.missouristate.edu/policy/G5_01_StudentRightsandResponsibilities.htm).

**Late Submission Policy**:

Late submissions are subject to the following penalty schedule:

* Submissions that are (0, 24] hours late are penalized 20%
* Submissions that are (24, 48] hours late are penalized 40%
* Submissions received 48 hours (about 2 days) beyond the due date are not
  graded and shall receive no credit.

Generally speaking, assignments are graded over the weekend. However, as most,
if not all, assignments are assessed via unit testing of the tasks involved, the
student should know a ballpark assessment of their work as these tests are
executed automatically with each push to GitHub. These same tests may be
manually executed at any time as well, by the student, giving them continuous
feedback on their work.

**Course Grades**

Final grades will be determined using a weighted average of the total points
you've earned during the semester. This average is mapped to letter grades using
the following mapping:

| Grade    | Letter Grade |
|----------|--------------|
| [93, ∞)  | A            |
| [90, 93) | A-           |
| [87, 90) | B+           |
| [83, 87) | B            |
| [80, 83) | B-           |
| [77, 80) | C+           |
| [73, 77) | C            |
| [70, 73) | C-           |
| [67, 70) | D+           |
| [63, 67) | D            |
| [60, 63) | D-           |
| [0, 60)  | F            |

## University Policies

### Accessibility/Academic Accommodation

If you are a student with a disability and anticipate barriers related to this
course, it is important to request accommodation and establish an accommodation
plan with the University. Please contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at
the [Disability Resource Center website](https://www.missouristate.edu/disability/),
Meyer Library, Suite 111, 417-836-4192, to initiate the process to establish
your accommodation plan. The DRC will work with you to establish your
accommodation plan, or it may refer you to other appropriate resources based on
the nature of your disability. To prepare an accommodation plan, the University
usually requires that students provide documentation relating to their
disability. Please be prepared to provide such documentation if requested. Once
a university accommodation plan is established, you may notify the class
instructor of approved accommodations. If you wish to utilize your accommodation
plan, it is suggested that you do so in a timely manner, preferably within the
first two weeks of class. Early notification to the instructor allows for full
benefit of the accommodations identified in the plan. Instructors will not
receive the accommodation plan until you provide that plan and are not required
to apply accommodation retroactively.

### Dropping a Class

It is your responsibility to understand the University's procedure for dropping
a class. If you stop attending this class but do not follow proper procedure for
dropping the class, you will receive a failing grade and will also be
financially obligated to pay for the class. For information about dropping a
class or withdrawing from the university, contact the Office of the Registrar at
836-5520. You can access the Academic Calendar on the MSU website to view drop
and refund deadlines for the semester.

### Academic Integrity Policy

Missouri State University is a community of scholars committed to developing
educated people who accept the responsibility to practice personal and academic
integrity. You are responsible for knowing and following the university's
academic integrity policy plus additional more-specific policies for each class.
The university policy, formerly known as the "Student Academic Integrity
Policies and Procedures" is available online
at [Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures (Students)](https://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op3_01_AcademicIntegrityStudents.htm)
and at the Reserves Desk in Meyer Library.

Examples of academic integrity violations include allowing someone else to copy
or use your assignments or exams, turning in papers used in other courses or
from the internet, and/or using notes or your book for a closed-book exam.
Plagiarism means presenting someone else's work as your own (e.g., copying or
paraphrasing someone else’s work without appropriate citations). Any student
participating in any form of academic dishonesty will be subject to sanctions as
described in this policy.

### Nondiscrimination Policy

Missouri State University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution
and maintains a grievance procedure available to any person who believes he or
she has been discriminated against. At all times, it is your right to address
inquiries or concerns about discrimination to the Office for Institutional
Equity and Compliance, Park Central Office Building, 117 Park Central Square,
Suite 111, (417) 836-4252. Other types of concerns (i.e., concerns of an
academic nature) should be discussed directly with your instructor and can be
brought to the attention of your instructor’s Department Head. Please visit
the [OEC](https://www.missouristate.edu/equity/) (Office for institutional
Equity and Compliance for additional information.

### Religious Accommodation

The University may provide reasonable accommodation based on a person's
religious belief. In making this determination, the University reviews a variety
of factors, including whether the accommodation would create an undue hardship.
The accommodation request imposes responsibilities and obligations on both the
individual requesting the accommodation and the University. Students who expect
to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments because of their held
religious belief shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to
complete such academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to
provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious observances on
which they will be absent by submitting a Request for Religious Accommodation
Form to the instructor by the end of the third week of a full semester course or
the end of the second week of a half semester course.

### Mental Health & Stress Management

As a student you may experience a range of personal issues that can impede
learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug
problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic
performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities.

the [Missouri State University Counseling Center](https://counselingcenter.missouristate.edu/)
website to learn more about free and confidential services available to assist
you.

### Title IX

Missouri State University has a Title IX policy that guides our response to
instances of sexual violence. Sexual Violence includes Rape, Sexual Assault,
Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Discrimination, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence,
Stalking, Sexual Harassment and Pregnancy issues. The Title IX policy can be
located on the [MSU Title IX website](https://www.missouristate.edu/titleix/).
This website is also a valuable resource for any questions or issues involving
Title IX and contains contact information for the MSU Title IX Office and staff.
Read
an [overview of the Title IX office](https://www.missouristate.edu/assets/Provost/TitleIX_OfficeOverview.pdf).

If an MSU student discloses a Title IX related issue to a MSU faculty or staff
member who is deemed to be a "Responsible Employee" under the policy, that
faculty or staff member is required to report such disclosure to the Title IX
Coordinator. A responsible employee includes any employee who has the authority
to take action to redress sexual violence; who has been given the duty of
reporting incidents of sexual violence or any other misconduct by students to
the Title IX Coordinator or other appropriate school designee; or whom a student
could believe has the authority or duty to act. Taylor Health employees and MSU
Counseling Center Clinicians are not considered to be Responsible Employees
under the policy, and therefore, are not required to report Title IX issues to
the Title IX Coordinator.

### Chosen Name Policy

A student may choose a name other than their legal name to identify themselves
at Missouri State University. A chosen name is different than the student’s
legal name. Refer to
the [Chosen Name policy](https://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op1_07_ChosenName.htm)
for more information. Students can provide their chosen first and middle names
in the _Profile_ tab of [My Missouri State](https://my.missouristate.edu/).
